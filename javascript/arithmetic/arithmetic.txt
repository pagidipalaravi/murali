What is arithmetic?
	Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers.
	They are:
		+ 	 -		Addition
		-	 -		Subtraction
		*	 -		Multiplication
		**	 -	    Exponentiation
		/ 	 -		Division
		% 	 -		Modulus (Division Remainder)
		++	 -	    Increment
		-- 	 -	    Decrement
Addition operator:
	It is used to add numbers.
	EX:
		let x = 1001 + 505;
Subtracting:
	The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers.
	EX:
	let x = 1001 - 505;
Multiplying:
	The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.
	EX:
	let x = 1001 * 505;
Dividing:
	The division operator (/) divides numbers.
	EX:
	let x = 100 ; 
	let	y = 50;
	let z = x / y;
Remainder:
	The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder.
	EX:
	let x = 100 ; 
	let	y = 50;
	let z = x % y;
Incrementing:
	The increment operator (++) increments numbers.
	EX:
		let x = 30;
			x++;
		let z = x;
		output: 31
Decrementing"
	The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers.
	EX:
	let x = 30;
		x++;
	let z = x;
		output: 29
Exponentiation:
	The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.
	EX:
		let x = 4;
		let z = x ** 3; 
		output: 64
		
	x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x,y).
	EX:
		let x = 4;
		let z = Math.pow(x,3); 
		output:	64
		
Operator Precedence:
	Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.
	EX:
		let x = 50 * 2 + 10;(BODMAS RULE)
		output: 110
