What is comments?
	JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code and more readable.
	It is also used to prevent execution.
	
	JavaSCript comments are divided into 2 types:
		1.Single Line comments.
		2.Multi-Line Comments.
		
	1.Single Line Comments:
		Single line comments start with //.
		Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).
		EX:
			let l, m;	//single line comment
            	l=10;
				m=20;
				
	2.Multi-Line Comments:
		Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
		Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
		EX:
			/*java
				HTML
				CSS
				JavaScript*/
				
	Using Comments to Prevent Execution:
		Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.
		Adding // in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment.
		
		EX:
			1.// document.getElementById('paragraph').innerHTML="start paragraph";
			
			2./* document.getElementById('paragraph').innerHTML="start paragraph";
			 document.getElementById('paragraph').innerHTML="start paragraph";/*
