What is syntax?
	JavaScript syntax is the set of rules.It is used to programs are constructed.
	Javascript syntax are divided into 2 types.They are	
		1.Fixed values
		2.variable values
	1.Fixed values:
		Fixed values are also called as"Literals".
	2.Variable values:
		Variable values are also called as"variables".
	
	JavaScript Literals:
		It is having 2 most important syntax's.
			1.Numbers.
			2.Strings.
		1.Numbers:
			Numbers are written with or without decimals.
			 EX:
				256,(number type)
				256.56(decimaltype)
		2.Strings:
			Strings are text, written within double or single quotes.
			EX:
				"murali"
				'murali'
	JavaScript Variables:
		Variables are used to store data values.
		JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
		"Equal sign" is used to assign values to "variables".
		let x;(x is a variable)
		x = 10;(10 is data,it is store in 'x' variable)
		
	JavaScript Operators:
		JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values.
		JavaScript uses an "assignment operator" ( = ) to assign values to variables:
			'+' (addition)
			'-' (substraction)
			'*' (multiplication)
			'/' (division)
			
		EX:
			x = 10+2*4/4;
	JavaScript Expressions:
		JavaScript expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
		The computation is called an "Evaluation".
		EX:
			10*30;
		Expressions can also contain variable values.
		EX:
			var x;
			x=10*2;
			x*10;
	The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
		EX:
			"java" + " " + "Script";
	
	JavaScript Keywords:
		JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.
		The "let" keyword tells the browser to create variables:
			EX:
				let l,m,n;
				l=10;
				m=20;
				n=l+m;
		The "var" keyword also tells the browser to create variables:
			EX:
				var p, q;
				p=40; q=40;
				
	JavaScript comments:
		JavaScript statements are Not all "executed".
		Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a "comment".
			comments tag:
					1.// (single statement comment)
					2./* and */(multiple statements comment)
					
				EX:
					x=10;// statement
	JavaScript Identifiers:
		Identifiers are "names".
		JavaScript identifiers are used to name variables (keywords, functions and labels).
		In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
			EX:
				m or _ or $; and m_&;
	NOTE:
		"Numbers" not allowed in as a First Character.
		
	JavaScript is a CaseSensitive:
		All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 
		EX:
			jammuKashmir;
	NOTE:
		JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword "let".
		
	JavaScript and Camelcase:
		Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name.
		
		1.Hyphens(-);
			first-name,FIRST-NAME,middle-Name are examples for Hyphens.
		NOTE:
			Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
			
		2.Underscore:
				first_name, last_Name, mumbai_Hyderabad etc..
				
		3.Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):
			UpperCamel Case are also called as"PascalCase";
				FirstName, LastName, HtmlCss etc..
				
		4.Lower camel case:
			Camel Case that starts with a lowercase letter.
			firstName, lastName, middleName etc..
		
	JavaScript Character set:
		JavaScript uses the "Unicode" character set.
		Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
			
			punctuation:
				. , ? etc..
			symbols:
				$, # etc..
