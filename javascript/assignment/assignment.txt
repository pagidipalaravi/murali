What is assignment operator?
	Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.
	They are:
		Operator	Example		Same As
			=		x = y		x = y
			+=		x += y		x = x + y
			-=		x -= y		x = x - y
			*=		x *= y		x = x * y
			/=		x /= y		x = x / y
			%=		x %= y		x = x % y
			**=		x **= y		x = x ** y
			
The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
	EX:
		let x = 10;
		output: 10
The += assignment operator adds a value to a variable.
	EX:
		let x = 90;
			x += 10;
		output:100
The -= assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable.
	EX:
	let x = 90;
		x -= 10;
		output:80
The *= assignment operator multiplies a variable.
	EX:
	let x = 10;
		x *= 10;
		output:100
The /= assignment divides a variable.
	EX:
	let x = 10;
		x /= 10;
		output:1
The %= assignment operator assigns a remainder to a variable.
	EX:
	let x = 10;
		x %= 10;
