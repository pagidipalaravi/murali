What is JS output?
	javaScript output "Displays" data in different ways:
		1.Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
		2.Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
		3.Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
		4.Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
	
	1.Using innerHTML:
		In HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.
		The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content.
	NOTE:
		Changing the innerHTML property of an HTML element is a common way to display data in HTML.
	
	2.Using document.write():
		Used for testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write().
	NOTE:
		Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML.
	
	Important point:
		The document.write() method should only be used for testing.
		
	3.Using window.alert():
		 It is used to an alert box to display data.
		 You can skip the "window" keyword also.
		 This also means that specifying the "window" keyword is optional.
		 
	4.Using console.log():
		It is is used to debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data.
		
	JavaScript print:
		JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.
		You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.
		The only exception is that you can call the window.print() the current window.
