What is JS const?
	"Const" is the JavaScript variable.It is introduced in ES6 (2015).
	The const cannot be ReDeclaring and Reassigned.
	Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
	
Cannot be Reassigned:
	const variable cannot be reassigned.
	
			EX: 
			const carName = "bmw";
					carName = "audi";
Must be assigned:
	const variables must be assigned a value are Declared.
		EX:
			const carName = "BMW";

Block Scope:
	Declaring a variable with const is similar to let in blockscope.
	
	EX:
		const x = 10;
		{
			const x = 20;
		}
		{
			const x = 30;
		}
		
		output: x = 10

ReDeclaring:
	Redeclaring "var" variable is allowed anywhere in a program.
	
	EX:
		var x =45;
		var x = 55;
			x = 66;
			
		output:66

Redeclaring an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, is not allowed.
	
	EX:
		var x = 10; // allowed
		const x = 10; // not allowed
		{
			let x = 20; // allowed
			const x = 20; // not allowed
		}
		{
			const x = 40; // allowed
			const x = 40; // not allowed
		}
		
Reassigning an existing const variable, in the same scope, is not allowed.
	
	EX:
		const x = 35; // Allowed
			x = 35;  // Not allowed
		var x = 35; // Not allowed
		let x = 35;  // Not allowed
		const x = 35; // Not allowed
		{
			const x = 45; / Allowed
			 x = 45;   // Not allowed
			 var x = 45; // Not allowed
			 let x = 45; // Not allowed
			 const x = 45; // Not allowed
		}
		
Redeclaring a variable with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed.
	
	EX:
		const x = 29; // Allowed
			{
			  const x = 35; // Allowed
			}

			{
			  const x = 45; // Allowed
			}
				
		output:	29
