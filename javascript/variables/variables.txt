How many ways we declare the JavaScript variables?
	JavaScript variables declare divided into 3 types.They are
		1.var
		2.let
		3.const
		
What is the difference between ES5 and ES6?
	ES5:
		1.ES5 is the fifth edition of ECMAScript(ECMA-European Computer Manufactures Association).
		2.It was introduced in the year 2009.
		3.ES5 supports primitive data types that are string, number, boolean, null and undefined.
		4.In ES5, we could only define the variables by using the "var" keyword.
	ES6:
		1.ES6 is the sixth editon of ECMAScript.
		2.It was introduced in the year 2015.
		3.ES6 supports primitive data type "Symbol".
		4.In ES6, there are two new ways to define variables that are "let" and "const".
		5.ES6 is the current version  we are using.
		
Variables:
	variables are used to store the data.
		EXAMPLE:
			var x = 70; x is stores the 70 value
			var y = 80; y is stores the 80 value
			var z = x + y; z is stores the 150 value(additon of x and y).
	Much like algebra:
		We are also used to  "Algebra".
		In algebra, we use variables (like cost1) to hold values.
		we use variables in expressions (total = cost1 + cost2).
		
		EXAMPLE:
				var cost1 = 444;
				var cost2 = 666;
				var total = cost1 + cost2;
				
JavaSCript Identifiers:
	JavaScript variables must be identified with "Unique names".
	These unique names are called "Identifiers".
	Identifiers can be short names like x and y.
		EX:
			var x;
			var y;
	
	It is also used to descriptive names like age, sum, totalvolume etc..
		EX:
			var cityName1 = "Hyderabad";
			var cityName2 = "Mumbai";
	The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
		1.Names can used to letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
			EX:
				javaSCript, element etc..
		2.Names must begin with a letter.
			Ex:
				var hyderabad;
		3.Names can also begin with $ and _ (dollar and underscore),but we will not use.
			EX:
				$javascript , _javascript. java_script etc..
		4.Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
			EX:
				var y = 45;
				var Y = 45;
				var z = y +Y;
		5.Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
		
		NOTE:
			JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
			Numbers are not allowed as the first character.
			
The Assignment Operator:
	Assignment Operator is the Equal sign opearator(=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
	EX:
		var x = 55;( "=" is a assignment operator).
	NOTE:
		The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.
		
JavaScript Data Types:
	JavaScript variables contains like numbers and text values.
	Text values are also called "Text strings".
	JavaScript can handle many types of data.
	Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
	If we give the quotes in numbers, it will be treated as like "text string".
		EX:
			var x = 1234;
			var cityName = "chennai";
			var foodName ='chapathi';
			
Declaring(creating) JavaScript Variables:
	Creating variable in JavaScript is called "Declaring".
	Declare a JavaScript variable with the "var" keyword.
		EX:
			var laptopBrand;
			
	After the declaration, the variable has no value(it means "Undefined").
		
		EX:
			var laptopBrand = "hp"; (correct method).
	After the declaration, the variable has value.(it means "defined").
	We create a variable called "laptopBrand" and assign the value "hp" to it.
	
One statement, Many Variables:
	We can also Declare the Variables in one statement.
	Start the statement with var and separate the variables by "Comma".
	 Ex:
		var employeName = "Naveen", employeId = 1234, employeDepartment = "javaDeveloper"; 
		
Undefined:
	The varible without having the value is called as "Undefined".
		EX:
			var bikeName;
			
Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables:
	If we Re-Declaring variable it doesn't lose its value.
		EX:	
			var firstName = "ajay";
			var firstName;
			
JavaScript Arithmetic:
	JavaScript Arithmetic operators like = and +.
	
	EX:
		var x = 10 + 20;
	We can also add "strings", but strings will be concatenated.
	
	EX:
		var x = "murali" + " " + "Krishna";
	
	We can also used in these way in JavaScript.
	
	EX:
		var x = "5" + 4 + 5;
		output:545
		var x = 5 + 4 + "5";
		output:95
		
	NOTE:
		If you put a number in "Quotes", the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
		
JavaScript Dollar Assign($):
	JavaScript identifiers "Names".
	1.Letters
	2.Dollar sign($)
	3.Underscore(_)
	
	EX:
		var $$$ = "how are you";
		var $ = 4;
		var $carPrice = "50000";
	In the JavaScript library jQuery, the main function "$" is used to select HTML elements.
	In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".
	
JavaScript UnderScore:
	JavaScript treated as a UnderScore as a letter.
	EX:
		var _firstName = "manishi";
		var _l = 40;
		var -4 = 40;
		
		
FAQS:
1.Can I write the <script> tag in the <body> tag?
	Yes, We can write the <script> tag in <body> tag.
	If we required write within the <body> tag.
	
2.In which situation we can write the <script> tag within the <body> tag?
	//TODO I need to  write the answer after completing 50% of course.

3.where I need to write the <script> tag  immediately after <body>  start tag or immediately before <body> end tag?
	It depends upon requirement.
	If I want to execute javascript immediately after the body start tag
	then i need to write script tag immediately after the body tag.
	If I want to execute javascript immediately before the body end tag
	then i need to write script tag immediately before the body end tag.
	
4.What are the difference between Var, Let and const ?
	var:
		"var" is used to "Re-Declaration" is possible.
		If we use to this we are getting some issues or errors.
		
	let:
		"let" is used to "Re-Declaration" is not possible.
		
	const:
		//TODO
	
5.What are the variable types? what is the difference between datatypes and variable types?
	 Variable types are var, let and const.
	 variable is used to store the data.
	 variale type must have datatypes associated with it.
	 Datatypes are like Strings, integer, float etc..
	 
6.What is the difference between variables and identifiers?
	Both an identifier and variables are the names allotted by users to a particular entity in a program.
	The identifier is only used to identify an entity uniquely in a program, variable is a name given to a memory location, that is used to hold a value.
	
7.Why we need to write <script> tag in the <body>tag?
	If we want to Excute the <script> tag in the <body> tag in that situation we are using <script> tag in the <body>tag.
