		It is used to build our application and deploys it.

		while we are running the server it will automatically reload if a file changed and making the development is quick and easy.
		This command build deploy serves and everytime watches if we are changing the code.If finding any changes code it will build
		and serve automatically.
How an angular app get started and loaded?
	The process it will started with index.html.In index.html it will configure the main.ts.
	In main.ts we have "platformBrowserDynamic" that bootstraps the "appModule" by invoking the "bootstrapmodule" function.
	syntax:
		platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
	After that main.ts configure the "app.Module.ts".
	In app.Module.ts we have bootsrap:[appcomponent] syntax, then it configure "app.component.ts".
	In app.component.ts we have selector, templateurl, styleurls.
		
		selector is having "app-root".
			selector: 'app-root'
			
		templateurl is having html file.
			templateUrl: './app.component.html'
			
		styleurls having css file.
			styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
			
	The process for angular application:
	
		index.html
			main.ts
				app.routing.ts
					app.module.ts
							app.component.ts
									app.component.html
											index.html
